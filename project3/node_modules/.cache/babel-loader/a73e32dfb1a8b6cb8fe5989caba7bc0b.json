We strive to develop caring, competent, and confident riders with our eclectic program, providing well-rounded curriculum that includes ring and trail riding, ground work, drill teams, games, jumping, basic dressage, vaulting and horse care. With a certified staff and well-trained horses, we strive to create a safe environment. No public trail rides offered at this time. We are not a traditional hunter/jumper barn geared towards horse shows but rather seek to provide an environment where riders can learn and experience a multitude of horse related experiences. Active participation in the care of our horses is required. However, we do hold several competitions each year. Traditionally, on the first Saturday in December we hold a show where each riding class performs a drill team pattern to music in themed costumes. The winning class performs in the Waxhaw Christmas Parade. Our farm is a US Pony Club training facility, and we enjoy fox hunting and hunter paces. Our riders are encouraged to participate in competitive trail riding with NATRC (North American Trail Ride Conference) and other competitive trail organizations. We also offer periodic trips to ride in the mountains, on the beach, and at international destinations. We welcome beginners to advanced riders looking to broaden their equestrian experiences. Teenage and older students may be taught how to teach and may learn to be assistant instructors. We own all of our horses and don\\u2019t board but can offer overnight accommodations to visitors. Riders are not required to own their horse, but if they do, we can help them with the training of the horse and rider. We also provide helmets, boots, and half chaps to borrow until students are fully committed to the sport and want to buy their own. Carol Land is the head instructor/trainer/owner and has been teaching riding since 1968. She was a CHA (Certified Horsemanship Association) Clinic Instructor, evaluating riding instructors and giving ratings for over 20 years. Carol grew up on a horse farm in upstate New York and started the equestrian program at Houghton College before moving to the Charlotte area. Horses have been an integral part of her life for over 55 years. Lessons are offered daily which follows the school schedule.  We do offer to ride over the breaks. We no longer offer trail rides to the public. At Shea Rose Farm, we seek to glorify God in all that we do and strive to provide an excellent, caring program with horses that are well attended. We are a family friendly farm and encourage visitors to come and check us out!\")));\n}\n\nexport default Header;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["C:/Users/ald24/Desktop/BootCamp/project3/project3/src/components/Header/index.js"],"names":["React","logo","Header"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAO,aAAP;AACA,OAAOC,IAAP,MAAiB,sCAAjB;;AAKA,SAASC,MAAT,GAAiB;AAEb,SACI;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,EAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI;AAAI,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAd;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBADJ,EAEI;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI;AAAK,IAAA,GAAG,EAAED,IAAV;AAAgB,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,0BAA1B;AAAqD,IAAA,MAAM,EAAC,KAA5D;AAAkE,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,KAAxE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADJ,CAFJ,CADJ,EAOI;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,kBAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI;AAAI,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,SAAd;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,eADJ,EAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,2pFAFJ,CAPJ,CADJ;AAiCH;;AAED,eAAeC,MAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from \"react\";\r\nimport './style.css';\r\nimport logo from '../../assets/images/sheaRoseLogo.png'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction Header(){\r\n    \r\n    return(\r\n        <div className=\"container\">\r\n            <div className=\"\">\r\n                <h1 className=\"text-center fonts\">Shea Rose Farm</h1>\r\n                <div className=\"p-3 my-4 m-auto\">\r\n                    <img src={logo} className=\"img-fluid m-auto d-block\" height=\"250\" width=\"250\"/>\r\n                </div>                \r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"text-center px-5\">\r\n                <h2 className=\"smFonts\">Welcome</h2>\r\n                <p>Shea Rose Farm was established in 1988 and for over 30 years has been providing a valuable service to the South Charlotte area.\r\n\r\n                    We strive to develop caring, competent, and confident riders with our eclectic program, providing well-rounded curriculum that includes ring and trail riding, ground work, drill teams, games, jumping, basic dressage, vaulting and horse care.
