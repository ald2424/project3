            <p>SHEA-ROSE FARM, INC. offers you and your family quality instruction at all levels of riding.  We cater to both the young rider [starting at age seven (7) for riding instruction and age six (6) for vaulting instruction] and the adult rider from beginner to advanced.  We offer special attention to those who are afraid of getting on a horse for first time or to those who, unfortunately, had bad experiences with horses in the past.</p>
            <p>WE love working with beginners as well as adults getting back into riding or just starting riding. Our vaulting program is truly unique and is a great way to learn how to ride. It's a total body workout!</p>
            <p>All of our horses and ponies are extremely well cared for, not overworked and are NEVER rented to the general public and therefore maintain their high degree of training. 
               Riding lessons are conducted predominantly on weekday afternoons during the school months and Vaulting practices are conducted on Monday afternoons.</p>
            <p>Our riders learn in one (1) hour group lessons or in one (1) hour private lessons (the lessons usually last approximately 1Â½ hours due to ground work requirements).  We teach and expose our students to all phases of caring for the horse and its equipment and stable care as well as instruction of hunt seat equitation, jumping, trail riding, training principles, games, drill team, and vaulting.
             We provide all needed safety equipment / attire including boots and helmets!</p>
            <h3>Lesson Policies</h3>
            <p>Lesson Payments - Payment of the lessons is due at the beginning of the month.  Please make all checks payable to:  Shea-Rose Farm, Inc.
                A $20.00 FEE will be charged on ALL RETURNED CHECKS

                Inclement Weather - Lessons are rarely canceled.  If the weather conditions prevent riding altogether or the weather becomes bad once you are here; a ground lesson will be conducted under shelter for the whole lesson or time remaining.  There is so much to learn besides just riding that the time will be well used.  The fee for inclement weather is the same as if you rode.

                Cancellations - Twenty-four (24) hour notice of cancellation must be given or payment for the lesson will by due on or before the next scheduled lesson.  If a student misses three (3) lessons in a row and has not made arrangements with SHEA-ROSE FARM, INC.  management to hold their lesson slot open for them, the student may be required to give up their slot to the next new student on a first-come first-ride basis.</p>
